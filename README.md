# Prerequisites

This project requires [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) or [Activator](https://www.typesafe.com/get-started) to compile, test and assemble.


Then, clone this repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/atware/coral-power.git
$ cd coral-power
```

Next, compile, test, assemble:

```
$ sbt assembly

This should compile the code, run the tests, and package the artefact to:
